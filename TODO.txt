- Delete in product_detail.html
Path for delete formed by product_tasks.js, so it's needed to make some workaround.
Till now I decline this function in product_detail.html
- Delete/Edit/Info functionality and buttons in orders
+ Fix: new order with no products (in cart)
- Decrease product from stock
- Add product from product page (query)
- Increase/Decrease product count buttons in cart
- Warning when creating order with out of stock product (example: two sellers create order with the same product,
in this way one of orders product quantity will be insufficient)
- Home app (main activity routes)
- Client and Orders action permissions
- Email / Telegram order notification
- Tests
- Docker
